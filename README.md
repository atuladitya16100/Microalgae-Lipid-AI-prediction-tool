# 🌱 Microalgae Lipid Productivity Predictor

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts microalgae lipid productivity (g/L/day) using a trained **linear regression** model. Given input parameters such as light intensity, pH, salinity, temperature, N:P ratio, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, lipid percentage, biomass, culture time, and strain, the app returns a predicted lipid yield.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Data-driven predictions** based on a regression model trained on experimental data.
- 🧑‍💻 **User-friendly UI** built with Streamlit — simply enter growth conditions.
- 📈 **Visualization** of the light intensity vs lipid productivity data to explore trends.
- 📏 **Performance metrics** displayed in-app (R² and RMSE) to show model accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- 🐍 **Python** (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- 📐 **scikit-learn** for model training and prediction
- 🎨 **Streamlit** for the web interface
- 📊 **Plotly** for interactive plots
