# Microalgae-Lipid-AI-prediction-tool
This project is a Streamlit web app that predicts microalgae lipid productivity (g/L/day) using a trained linear regression model. Users input parameters like light, pH, salinity, nutrients, and strain, and the app returns the estimated lipid yield with a quick data visualization.
